# Latex Current Opinion Annotated Bib
Snippets of LaTeX/Bibtex showing how to make an annotated bibliography (especially useful for Current Opinion journals with 'outstanding interest' and 'special interest' tiers of references)

License: LPPL (note: the `currbiol.bst` file is a slightly-modified version of a bst file found online. The original file had been generated automatically).

These files have been tested in [Overleaf](http://overleaf.com) and require compiling with bibtex. All information on how to write/modify bst files came from [this very helpful document](http://ctan.org/pkg/tamethebeast)

See files in the `examples/` directory for a minimal demonstration of how to use the `currbiol.bst` file.
